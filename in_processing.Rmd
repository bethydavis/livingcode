```{r}
## Check all files were downloaded 
```{r}
## File path to data used in this script
data_path <- paste0(getwd(), "/data/skillshare")
# Count files inside the folder to make sure the number of files downloaded is what is expected.
length(list.files(data_path))

```


```{r}
## List with all csv files in raw data
all_csv <- tibble(list.files(data_path, pattern = ".csv")) %>% 
  rename(file_name = 1) %>% 
  mutate(path = paste0(data_path, "/", file_name),
         n = 1:n(),
         type = "skillshare") %>% 
  unite(obj_name, type, n, sep = "_", remove = FALSE)

## function to read csv and clean names as we read the file
read_csv_clean <- function(dataset){
  read_csv(dataset) %>% 
    clean_names()}
```

```
